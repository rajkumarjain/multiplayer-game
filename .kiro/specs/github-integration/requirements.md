# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds GitHub integration capabilities to the multiplayer Ludo game, enabling players to authenticate with GitHub, save game statistics, and share game results. The integration will provide social features while maintaining the core real-time multiplayer gameplay experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to sign in with my GitHub account, so that I can save my game progress and statistics across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Sign in with GitHub" button THEN the system SHALL redirect them to GitHub OAuth authorization
2. WHEN GitHub authorization is successful THEN the system SHALL store the user's GitHub profile information and return them to the game
3. WHEN a user is signed in THEN the system SHALL display their GitHub username and avatar in the game interface
4. WHEN a user signs out THEN the system SHALL clear their session and remove GitHub profile information from the interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a signed-in player, I want my game statistics to be tracked and saved, so that I can see my performance over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a signed-in user completes a game THEN the system SHALL record the game result (win/loss) to their profile
2. WHEN a signed-in user wins a game THEN the system SHALL increment their win count
3. WHEN a signed-in user loses a game THEN the system SHALL increment their loss count
4. WHEN a signed-in user views their profile THEN the system SHALL display their total games played, wins, losses, and win percentage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to share my game victories on GitHub, so that I can celebrate wins with my developer community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a signed-in user wins a game THEN the system SHALL offer an option to share the victory
2. WHEN a user chooses to share a victory THEN the system SHALL create a GitHub Gist with game details
3. WHEN creating a victory Gist THEN the system SHALL include game duration, opponents, and final board state
4. WHEN the Gist is created successfully THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message with the Gist URL

### Requirement 4

3. WHEN anonymous players join a game room THEN the system SHALL display them as "Guest" players
4. IF a player has GitHub integration enabled THEN the system SHALL show a GitHub icon next to their name

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the GitHub integration to be optional, so that players can still enjoy the game without requiring a GitHub account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL provide both "Play as Guest" and "Sign in with GitHub" options
2. WHEN a user chooses to play as guest THEN the system SHALL allow full game functionality without GitHub features
3. WHEN GitHub API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to guest-only mode
4. WHEN a signed-in user's GitHub token expires THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication without disrupting active games

**User Story:** As a player, I want my GitHub integration to work securely, so that my account information is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing OAuth THEN the system SHALL use GitHub's official OAuth 2.0 flow
2. WHEN storing user tokens THEN the system SHALL encrypt them and store them securely
3. WHEN making GitHub API calls THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting appropriately
